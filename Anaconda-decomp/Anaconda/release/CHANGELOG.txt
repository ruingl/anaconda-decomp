Revision 5:
- Lots of optimizations (thanks a lot to Bruto for his very well-made,
  but performance-hungry game :-)
  - The INI object now uses pure C to parse files
  - Some data loading routines have been optimized in C
  - Frames are delay-loaded, so the initial startup-time is faster
- Bugfixes
- Missing counter features implemented
- Fixed objects being destroyed even though they had "On object clicked"
  conditions
- Stand-alones have now switched to an executable + data directory structure
  to improve startup load times (for Linux and Windows, but Mac has also
  changed it's build system, even though it still uses the Resource directory). 
  This also means that you should place your Splash.png file in the data 
  directory.
